[] : references of elements in the code itself

ALARM CLOCK
	Creating a double linked list [ sleep_list ] storing the sleeping threads. 
	The caller of [ thread_block() ] adds itself as [ thread struct element ] and its sleeping time ([ wakeup_tick ]) to the list.
	The [ timer_interrupt ] handler will then loop through the entire global [ sleep_list ] until it's empty to check if it has to be woken up
		- if so it deletes it from the list and unblocks the thread using [ thread_unblock(struct thread) ]
		- if not it continues looping through the list
	
	issue with this design	: not using a sorted list so we haveto loop through all the threads in the list to know which one to unblock
	possible improvement 	: find a way to define a score to sort the list (either by checking the priority or by updating in real time the different wakeup_ticks needed
